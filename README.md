# Sales_Dashboard
Made an easy-to-use dashboard in Power BI to track sales.  Shows total sales, profit, top products, and sales by region and time.  Added filters so users can check details by month, year, or product category.  Used charts, graphs, and maps to make the data clear and simple to understand.
